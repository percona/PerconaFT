    // This is a fair readers-writers lock.  It has two extra properties
    // beyond a vanilla fair rw lock: 
    //
    //  1) It can tell you whether waiting on a lock may be
    //     "expensive".  This is done by requiring anyone who obtains
    //     a write lock to say whether it's expensive, and keeping
    //     track of whether any expensive write request is either
    //     holding the lock or in the queue waiting.
    //
    //  2) It records the context and thread id of the writer who is
    //     currently blocking any other thread from getting the lock.
    //     It does this by recording the context and thread id when a
    //     writer gets the lock, or when a reader gets the lock and
    //     the next item in the queue is a writer.
    //
    // The implementation employs a std::queue of frwlock_queueitems
    // (which contain a condition variable, a bool indicatin whether
    // the request is a reader or a writer, and the threadid and
    // context of the requesting thread.
    //
    // When a reader or writer tries, and cannot get, the lock, it
    // places a condition variable into the queue.
    //
    // When a reader releases a lock, it checks to see if there are
    // any other readers still holding the lock, and if not, it
    // signals the next item in the queue (which is responsible for
    // fremoving itself from the queue, and if it is a reader, for
    // signaling the next item in the queue if it is a reader).
    //
    // When a writer releases a lock, it signals the next item in the
    // queue.
